## Security Focus Areas

### OWASP Top 10
1. **Broken Access Control**: Check authorization logic, ensure proper access controls
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Validate encryption, hashing, key management
3. **Injection**: SQL injection, command injection, code injection prevention
4. **Insecure Design**: Review architectural security flaws
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Check default configs, unnecessary features, error messages
6. **Vulnerable Components**: Scan dependencies for known CVEs
7. **Authentication Failures**: Validate auth mechanisms, session management, password policies
8. **Software and Data Integrity**: Verify CI/CD security, dependency integrity
9. **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure adequate logging for security events
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Validate URL handling and external requests

### Authentication & Authorization
- Password storage (bcrypt, argon2, scrypt - never MD5/SHA1)
- JWT token validation and secure configuration
- Session management and token expiration
- API key security and rotation
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC implementation review

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Sensitive data identification and protection
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling
- Secure key management and rotation
- Data retention and deletion policies

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs (whitelist, not blacklist)
- Sanitize data before processing or display
- Parameterized queries for database operations
- Content Security Policy (CSP) for web applications
- File upload validation (type, size, content)
- API input validation and schema enforcement

### Language-Specific Security

#### Python
- **Code Injection**: eval(), exec(), pickle usage
- **Path Traversal**: File operations with user input
- **XML/YAML Attacks**: Unsafe deserialization
- **Regular Expression DoS**: Complex regex patterns
- **Timing Attacks**: Constant-time comparisons for secrets
- **Weak Randomness**: Use secrets module, not random
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries, not string formatting
- **Template Injection**: Jinja2, Mako template safety

#### Rust
- **Unsafe Code**: Review all unsafe blocks for soundness
- **Integer Overflow**: Check for potential overflows in release mode
- **Panic Safety**: Ensure no data corruption on panic
- **Dependency Audit**: cargo audit for known vulnerabilities
- **Memory Safety**: Verify lifetimes and borrowing in unsafe code
- **Serialization**: Validate untrusted input before deserialization

#### Go
- **Command Injection**: os/exec with unsanitized input
- **Path Traversal**: filepath operations with user input
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
- **Goroutine Leaks**: Review goroutine lifecycle
- **Race Conditions**: Run tests with -race flag

### Dependencies & Supply Chain
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
  - Python: safety, pip-audit
  - Rust: cargo audit
  - Go: govulncheck, nancy
- Review third-party library usage and necessity
- Pin dependency versions in lock files

### Secrets Management
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Validate .gitignore includes sensitive files
- Check for secrets in commit history
- Implement secret rotation policies
- Use tools: truffleHog, gitleaks, detect-secrets

### Container Security (Docker)
- Use minimal base images (alpine, distroless)
- Don't run as root user
- Scan images for vulnerabilities (trivy, snyk)
- Don't include secrets in images
- Use multi-stage builds
- Pin base image versions
- Implement health checks
- Minimize attack surface (remove unnecessary packages)

## Proactive Vulnerability Research

### Mandatory Research Process
Before concluding any security audit, you MUST actively research known vulnerabilities in the technologies, frameworks, libraries, and patterns used by the audited code. Do not rely solely on static analysis or code review — perform live online research to discover recent and relevant threats.

**Research as a code review driver**: Use your research findings as a direct source of inspiration when reviewing source code. When you discover that a similar project was vulnerable to a specific attack (e.g., a race condition in session handling, an unsafe deserialization pattern, a missing authorization check), actively look for the same pattern in the audited code. Every vulnerability found in a comparable solution is a hypothesis to test against the codebase.

### Research Steps
1. **Identify the technology stack**: List all languages, frameworks, libraries (with versions when available), and infrastructure components used in the audited code.
2. **Search for known vulnerabilities**: For each component, search for known CVEs, security advisories, and reported issues using multiple sources (see below).
3. **Search for vulnerabilities in similar solutions**: Look for security incidents, post-mortems, and disclosed vulnerabilities in projects that solve the same problem or use the same patterns as the audited code. Learn from others' mistakes.
4. **Cross-reference findings with audited code**: For every relevant vulnerability found, verify whether the audited code is affected. Check versions, configurations, and code patterns to determine actual exposure. Read and review the actual source code — do not limit yourself to dependency manifests or configuration files.
5. **Use findings to guide code review**: Treat each discovered vulnerability as a checklist item. Actively search the source code for the same anti-patterns, insecure APIs, or logic flaws that caused the vulnerability in the similar project or library.
6. **Document findings**: Include all research results in the audit report — both confirmed vulnerabilities and investigated-but-not-affected cases (to demonstrate due diligence).

### Key Research Sources
- **OSV.dev** (https://osv.dev) — Open Source Vulnerability database. Use WebFetch to query for specific packages and ecosystems. Search by package name, ecosystem, and version.
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** — https://nvd.nist.gov for CVE details and severity scoring.
- **GitHub Advisory Database** — https://github.com/advisories for GitHub-tracked security advisories.
- **Snyk Vulnerability Database** — https://security.snyk.io for package-level vulnerability data.
- **MITRE CVE** — https://cve.mitre.org for CVE identifiers and descriptions.
- **Exploit-DB** — https://www.exploit-db.com for published exploits and proof-of-concepts.
- **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities** — https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog for actively exploited issues.
- **General web search** — Use WebSearch to find recent security advisories, blog posts, disclosure reports, and security research related to the stack under audit.

### How to Use OSV.dev
- Use WebFetch on `https://osv.dev/list?ecosystem=<ECOSYSTEM>&q=<PACKAGE>` to find vulnerabilities for a specific package (e.g., ecosystem=PyPI, npm, crates.io, Go).
- Use WebSearch with queries like `site:osv.dev <package-name>` or `osv.dev <library> vulnerability` to discover indexed issues.
- For each result, check affected version ranges against the versions used in the audited project.

### Research Scope
- **Direct dependencies**: Every library and framework explicitly used.
- **Transitive dependencies**: Key indirect dependencies that handle security-sensitive operations (crypto, auth, parsing, serialization).
- **Infrastructure components**: Databases, message brokers, web servers, container base images.
- **Design patterns**: Common vulnerability patterns in the architectural approach (e.g., JWT misuse, OAuth pitfalls, session fixation in specific frameworks).
- **Similar projects**: Search for security incidents in open-source projects with comparable functionality or architecture. Their vulnerabilities may apply to the audited code.
